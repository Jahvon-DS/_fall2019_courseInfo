Ever thought about a problem and said, “There should be an app for that”? 
This course provides an introduction to computer programming using modern 
programming languages as a way to solve problems. It focuses on programming 
concepts and fundamentals within the context of solving real world problems.

**Please read the syllabus (syllabusINF108f2019.pdf) for more 
information.**

---

 * **howToCloneRepository.md** contains a walkthrough of creating a 
repository on the unix command line
 
 * **syllabusINF465f2019.pdf** is the syllabus. Read it. You 
know how they say there is no such thing as a bad question? They're 
wrong. A bad question is when you ask a question and the answer was in 
the syllabus all along. If you have a question, make sure it hasn't 
already been answered. If you ask a question to clarify something 
specific that you found confusing *after* reading the syllabus, that 
is appropriate and encouraged. 

* **achievementList.pdf** is the list of possible achievements for the course.
If you aren't sure what it's for, read about grading in the syllabus.

* **individualActivities** is a folder containing all individual homework
assignments. These aren't mandatory (see grading & achievements in the syllabus)
but you will need to do a certain number of them to reach certain grades.

* **teamActivities** is a folder containing all in-class team activities.
Like individual activities, these aren't mandatory. However, you will have
trouble doing well in the class if you don't participate as regularly as possible.

* **Handy links**
